### Context of this module
Engineering aspects of the **creation** of **large** and **complex software systems** by a (potentially large) **group** of software engineers and other scientists and engineers.
# Software Engineering Analysis
1. Why do we need **Software Engineering**? / Where’s the problem?
2. What is a **Software Process**?
3. What kinds of **Software Process models** exist and what are the differences?
4. How can we **analyze the requirements**?
5. What are **software metrics** and how to apply them?
6. What is **UML**?
7. How can we **work together in a team** and how does software project management work?

# Why Software Engineering?
Three-quarters of all large software products delivered to the customer are failures that are either not used at all, or do not meet the customer's requirements

### Software engineering layers

* **Quality Focus**: Everything must be based on an organizational commitment to quality
* **Processes**: The key process areas form the basis for management control of software projects and establish the context in which technical methods are applied
* **Methods**: Software engineering methods provide the technical how-to’s for building software
* **Tools**: are integrated so that information created by one tool can be used by another in order to support the software development
### Three phases of software development
![](/assets/img/2020-01-13-18-51-19.png)
* Definition Phase: focus on **what**:
    * System or information engineering
    * Software project planning
    * Requirement analysis
* Development Phase: Focus on **how**:
  * Software design
  * Code generation
  * Software testing (QA)
* Support Phase: Focus on **change**:
   * Corrective maintenance (bugfixes) 
   * Adaptive maintenance (adapt to changed environment) 
   * Perfective maintenance (extensions beyond original functional requirements) 
   * Preventive maintenance (reengineering) ensures ability to change software 
   * Customer support (consulting, help desk, web-pages, forums, etc.)

==> CONCLUSION: Supporting activities:  
* Project management
* Configuration management
* Change management
* Quality assurance
* User experience
