### The EXISTS function

used to check whether the result of a correlated nested query is empty (no tuples) or not

## INSERT INTO

```
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

Attributes with NULL values can be left out. But when tuple contains many NULL. We should:

```
INSERT INTO
EMPLOYEE(fname, lname, snn)
VALUES('Richard', 'Marini', '655584758');
```

We can insert result table to new table:

```
create table DEPTS_INFO ('DEPT_NAME     VARCHAR(10),
                          NO_OF_EMPS    INTEGER,
                          TOTAL_SAL     INTEGER);
insert into DEPTS_INFO (DEPT_NAME, NO_OF_EMPS, TOTAL_SAL)
select      dname, count(*), sum(salary)
from        department, employee
where       dnumber=dno
group by    dname;
```

## DELETE

removes tuples from a relation using WHERE to select the tuples to be deleted

```
delete from     employee
where           lname='Brown'

delete from     employee
where           dno in
                (select     dnumber
                 from       department
                 where      dname='Research')
```

To delete all tuples, just left WHERE missing

```
delete from  employee
```
