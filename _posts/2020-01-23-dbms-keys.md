[DBMS Keys: Primary, Candidate, Super, Alternate and Foreign (Example)](https://www.guru99.com/dbms-keys.html)
## Relation Schema
A relation schema `R = {A1, A2,... ,An}` **contains all attributes**

## Superkey
* A `super key` is a **subset of R**
* A `super key` is a **set of attributes** (columns), which can **uniquely identify a row in a table**.

## Key
* A `key` **is** a `superkey`
* but has _additional property_ that **removal** of **any attribute** from `key` => **not** a `superkey` anymore.

## Candidate key
A `candidate key` is a **minimal set of attributes** (or `minimal superkey`) make to **tuples unique**.

### Primary key
One of the `candidate keys` is **arbitrarily designated** to be the `primary key`.  
And the others are called `secondary keys`.

## Prime & Nonprime attribute
* A `prime attribute` **must be an attribute** of `candidate key`
* A `nonprime attribute` is an **attribute that not belong** to `candidate key`

`Prime attribute` is also called `key attribute`.  
`nonprime attribute` is also called `nonkey attribute`.
